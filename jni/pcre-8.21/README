Building libpcre under Android

Download the latest source of pcre from http://www.pcre.org/ here, making this the PCRE base directory. The provided _Android.mk should be renamed to Android.mk to enable the building of libpcre.so.  

The present version of jconsole-for-android uses pcre-8.21 although any modern version should do. The J scripts which use libpcre.so use the posix finctions exclusively.

As the Android NDK is NOT a './configure'-enabled platform, config.h is created by manually editing config.h.in.  An sample has been provided which can likely be used instead if you are unsure what to do.  The macro HAVE_CONFIG_H must be defined during the coompilation cycle.  This is taken care of with the provided Android.mk
