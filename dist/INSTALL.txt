In order to install this on Android:
The follwing are instructions which apply to any non-market app.

Your device must be Android 2.1 or greater.

Before installation, go to 
	Settings -> Applications -> Allow Non-Market Apps; set to on

You will need a file manager app.  If you do not have one, go to the market and get one; anyone will do.

To install: 
	j-console.apk must first be physically transferred to your device. This may be done with an sdcard or by transferring via USB while the device is attached to your computer. When j-console.apk is on your device and visible to your file manager, click it.  This should initiate the installation.  Once the app is installed, you may safely delete the apk file.

If you have a problem installing, please check the md5sum of the downloaded package.

[michael@android dist]$ md5sum j-console.apk

See the README file packaged with the app (via Help->README) for instructions on enabling the softkeyboard.
